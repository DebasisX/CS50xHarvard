Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Some of the predictions are incorrect as when we increase the no. of simulations their winning rate decreases quite quickly.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
100000 simulations would be enough as after that it starts repeating and the jump in time cost is below a second.
