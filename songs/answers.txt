SELECT name FROM songs;
SELECT name FROM songs ORDER BY tempo;
SELECT name from songs ORDER BY duration_ms DESC LIMIT 5;
SELECT name FROM songs WHERE danceability >= 0.75 AND energy >= 0.75 AND valence >= 0.75;
SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs;
SELECT name FROM songs WHERE artist_id = (SELECT id FROM artists WHERE name = "Post Malone");
SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs WHERE artist_id = (SELECT id FROM artists WHERE name = "Drake");
SELECT name FROM songs WHERE name LIKE '%feat.%';

If this were the Top 100 of one listener his/her Audio Aura would be 'Yellow' as we can see in the Data,
the Danceability is a bit more than energy and valence is least which means he/she does is not Green.
Yellow: Yellows like their music to align them to the goals of their day, fueling their need for focus, motivation,
and self improvement all while reducing any nerves that could get in the way.

This does not give us a very good idea or representation of the person as we have not considered their Genre and the Volume
they play their music at, these two along with many other factors can lead to a more proper representation of the Listener.
